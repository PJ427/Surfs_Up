# Surfs_Up
Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview:

  We are tasked to provide data on temperature trends on the Island of Oahu before opening the surf shop. Specifically, we need temperature data for the months of June and December, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

The results from our analysis of the temprature on the Island of Oahu in the months of June and December shows:

    1. Junes tempratures are higher than December 
    
    2. the greatest fluctuation is the minimum temps, approximately 8 degree difference, which might not promote surfing or ice cream.
    
    3. the temperature difference is minimal (as depicted in the charts below)

## Summary:

  Our results show that the Surf-n-Cream shop is definitely sustainable year round on the Island of Oahu.  Though there is some changes in weather in regards to precipitation and temprature it is not siginificant enough to prevent the venture from being successful.
  
  Further analysis on number of days of the December minimum tempratures could be beneficial, however, with the variances of the other temp ranges, I think it safe to say that Hawaii has great weather year round.
